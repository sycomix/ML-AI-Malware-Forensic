# ML-AI-Malware-Forensic
Working draft
Project Description:
  Malware are becoming stealthier and more complex, and thus more difficult to find and analyze. In response to this, 
  different plug-ins are developed for memory forensic and analysis tools, such as Volatility. These, however, generate
  large amounts of data to be analyzed. Due to the difficulty of analyzing memory images for forensic evidence, and the
  possibility of missing potentially crucial information, we have constructed a pipeline for the creation, processing,
  and analysis and classification of memory images. First, the images are created via snapshot of a virtual machine. 
  Then, different features are extracted thorough several volatility plug-ins automatically run on the image. The data 
  is then pre-processed, and finally analyzed and classified using machine learning. 
  
  Pre-Requisites:
    Volatility frame work for memory forensics. 
    OS Memory dump 
  Execution:
  To generate volatility reports for given memory dump.
    
    $python MainVol.py [name-of-memory-image]
  
  To classify processes into normal or malicious (different categories of malicious activities).
    
    $python2 mainfile.py
    
  
  Detailed Description:
    
    MainVol.py: Extracts reports using volatility from memory dump
    mainfile.py calls featureExtractor.py which extract features from files generated by MainVol.py. It cleans the data, 
    pre-process the data and also converts the values into binary(to simplify classification) 
    dtree.py: Executes deciscion tree classifier over cleaned feature set generated by mainfile.py and classify the process into
    different classes based on their behavior.
    meta_file2.py: Generated Bunch from dataset.
    Bunch:
    Dictionary-like object, the interesting attributes are: ‘data’, the data to learn, ‘target’, the classification labels, 
    ‘target_names’, the meaning of the labels, ‘feature_names’, the meaning of the features, and ‘DESCR’, the full description
    of the dataset.
